 ===========================Steps for porting BMV31T001 Module to HT32 Starter Kit.===========================
 Step 1. Modify example_xxxxx\_ProjectConfig.ini.
         - Add DEVICE_NAME
         Example [take HT32F52352 as an example]:
           REM DEVICE_NAME
           REM ============================================================================
           52352

 Step 2. Modify example_xxxxx\ht32_board_config.h.
         - Add module communication interface pin setting
         Example [take HT32F52352 as an example]:
            #if defined(USE_HT32F52352_SK)
            

 ===========================Steps for porting BMV31T001 Module to Another Vendor's MCU.=======================
 Step 1. Unzip File:
         - Start by unzipping "BMV31T001_HT32_Vm.n.r.zip".

 Step 2. Port Source Code:
         - Migrate the src directory to your target project.

 Step 3. Include in Compilation:
         - Open the Keil project and add src to your project.
	 - Add include path on your project target setting.

 Step 4. Modify src:
         1- delay.c,the BFTM0 clock adapte to your target MCU
		(1) delay_us(u32 nus)	
	 2- BMV31T001.c Change Port adapte to your connected wire.on defined area.
		
	 3- BMV31T001.c If you need to update voice source.ReWrite the Serial funtion
		(1)USBSerial_begin(baudrate);defaulted is Vitrue Serial
                (2)USBSerial_available()
		(3)USBSerial_readBytes(param1,param2);
		(4)USBSerial_write_byte(param);
